# Unix home files #

I'm sharing my dotfiles folder that I use in my diferent servers and machines
with very different needs.

The objective is to have a system to detect in what specific host you are and
detect the architecture. I created these files having in mind that idea, and
a bit inspired by [bthemad dotfiles repo](https://github.com/bthemad/dotfiles
"bthemad dotfiles repo").

Please take a look to it and share with me any improvement or suggestion you
would like to see there.
